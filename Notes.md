# Notes

1. The PDF files in the Assets folder have **Arabic** notes to make them easier to understand. The same files are available in the link (Provided by Sultan) in **Word** and **PDF** formats, uploaded online.

2. The uploaded **PDF** and **Word** files are free of notes to be entered into the application or system directly and used.

3. All uploaded files have exact names that match the names of the files that were included in the Assets folder.

4. In some Modifications/Changes, there is data that already exists. We assume that the programmer knows where to call it from.

5. If there are any questions while working on the program, you can direct them to Sultan.
