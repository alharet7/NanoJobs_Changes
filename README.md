# NanoJobs_Changes


## change 1:
Add a new link at the Home Navbar for the branches - the link name **Farnchise**. The **Farnchise** link will go to a new web page containing a text and at the end of the page will be two fields to fill, just like the Contact Us fields:

 - First field: User Email

 - Second field: A text box to write the questions and notes

## Change4:
The **worker-data-info** page will be split into two sections:

 - The First section will be for the data the worker has already filled. (There are changes on the phone app which will be covered later in these docs.)

 - The Second section will have 9 fields that the Admin should fill.

The **Exit Date** field In the **worker-data-info** page should accept (None/No value) so it handle two cases (if there is an Exit Date or if it's empty! no date)
